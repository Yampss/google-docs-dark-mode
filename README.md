# Google Docs Dark Mode

A simple, lightweight Chrome extension that provides a comfortable and visually consistent dark mode for Google Docs. This extension is designed to reduce eye strain during late-night writing sessions by transforming the entire Google Docs interface, including the document canvas, into a dark theme.

## Features

- **Full Dark Mode:** Applies a dark theme to the Google Docs UI, toolbars, menus, and the document itself.
- **Intelligent Canvas Inversion:** Inverts the colors of the document's canvas to make the page dark and text light, while keeping images and other media in their original colors.
- **Easy Toggle:** A simple click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar toggles dark mode on or off.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** No unnecessary features or tracking. Just a clean, dark theme.

## Installation

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it manually by following these steps:

1.  **Download the code:**
    *   Click the green **Code** button on this GitHub page.
    *   Select **Download ZIP**.
    *   Extract the downloaded `.zip` file into a permanent folder on your computer (e.g., in your Documents folder).

2.  **Install in Chrome:**
    *   Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    *   In the top-right corner, turn on **Developer mode**.
    *   Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears on the top-left.
    *   Select the folder where you extracted the extension files (the folder that contains `manifest.json`).

The extension is now installed and ready to use!

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to a Google Docs page (`https://docs.google.com/document/...`).
2.  Click the extension's icon (a small Google Docs logo) in your Chrome toolbar.
3.  Dark mode will be instantly applied. Click the icon again to toggle it off.
